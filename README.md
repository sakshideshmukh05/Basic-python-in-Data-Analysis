# Basic-python-in-Data-Analysis
Python is a dynamic, interpreted (bytecode-compiled) language. 
There are no type declarations of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code. 
This makes the code short and flexible, and you lose the compile-time type checking of the source code.

# Basic Concepts of Python 
# Variable: 
           Python variables are simply containers for storing data values.
           Unlike other languages, such as Java, Python has no command for declaring a variable, so you create one the moment you first assign a value to it.
           Python variables are simply containers for storing data values.
           In Python, there are four different types of variables: int, float, str, and bool.
# Operators:
            Operators refer to special symbols that perform operations on values and variables. 
            Furthermore, the operands in python, one of the programming languages, refer to the values on which the operator operates.
            Most noteworthy, operators can carry out arithmetic, relational, and logical operations.

         Operator      	Description	        Syntax
           +	    Addition: adds two         x + y
                       operands	             
           –	    Subtraction: subtracts     x – y
                   two operands	            
           *	    Multiplication:multiplies  x * y
                   two operands	
          /     	Division (float):divides   x / y
                 the first operand by 
                    the second	
         //	     Division (floor):divides    x // y
                the first operand by the
                   second	
         %	    Modulus:returns the           x % y
                 remainder when the first 
                 operand is divided by 
                 the second	
         **	    Power: Returns first          x ** y
                raised to power second	

# Conditional Statments:
                       Conditional statements (if, else, and elif) are fundamental programming constructs that allow you to control the flow of your program based on conditions that you specify.
                       They provide a way to make decisions in your program and execute different code based on those decisions
  # 1) if Statement:
                The if statement is a conditional statement in Python used to determine whether a block of code will be executed. 
                If the program finds the condition defined in the if statement true, it will execute the code block inside the if statement.

  # 2) if-else Statement:
                       the if statement executes the code block when the condition is true. 
                       Similarly, the else statement works in conjuncture with the if statement to execute a code block when the defined if condition is false.
